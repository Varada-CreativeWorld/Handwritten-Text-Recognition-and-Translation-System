## Prject Description

This project is an **Offline Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) System** that transcribe Hindi Character or English word contained in scanned images into digital text and display the output in Web Page. In addition to transcribing, translation of text from Hindi to English and vice-versa  is also incorporated using python API.

To accomplish the above task of transcribing, Two main apporached have been used:
classifying words directly and character segmentation. 

For the former,Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used with various architectures to train a model that can accurately classify words. 
For the latter,Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM) was used with convolution to construct bounding boxes for each character. 
Then the segmented characters were passed to a CNN for classification, and then reconstruct each word according to the results of classification and segmentation. 

The model is developed using **Tensorflow and Keras**, and the Web Application using **React and Flask** Frameworks.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
